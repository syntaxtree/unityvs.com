<p>At Unite last week in Amsterdam, one question we had that came up quite often was: when are we going to add support for Unity 4? Our answer usually was that we'll work on it as soon as we're back home. And that's exactly what we did!</p>

<p>As you can see in our <a href="/documentation/changelog">ChangeLog</a>, our last update to UnityVS adds a preview support of the Unity 4 beta. Obviously, we'll officially support it as soon as Unity 4 is released.</p>
