<p>Unity 4.2 introduced a new callack that allows you to control how files are opened from Unity.</p>

<p>This is excellent news for UnityVS as it fixes an outstanding known issue: previously, clicking on a console line in Unity would not open the file in UnityVS at the proper line unless <a href="/documentation/issues/">you worked around it</a>.</p>

<p>Until this is supported directly into UnityVS, you can simply drop the following script in a Editor folder of your Unity 4.2 project to make sure that clicking on the console will open UnityVS at the proper line.</p>
