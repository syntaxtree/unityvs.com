<p>We're proud to announce today the release of UnityVS 1.0.</p>

<p>UnityVS is a commercial product of <a href="http://syntaxtree.com" target="_blank">SyntaxTree</a>. UnityVS is a bridge between <a href="http://www.unity3d.com" target="_blank">Unity</a>, a fantastic tool for video game development or interactive content creation, and <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/en-us" target="_blank">Visual Studio</a>, the renowned development environment from Microsoft.
</p>

<p>UnityVS is packed with <a href="/features/">useful features</a> for the Unity programmer. With UnityVS you can debug your games from Visual Studio while they are running in the Unity Editor: just press F5 to attach the Visual Studio Debugger to Unity without interrupting your workflow! UnityVS also adds support to Visual Studio to all the programming languages that you can use to program Unity: UnityScript and Boo.
</p>

<p>As of today, UnityVS requires Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 and Unity 3.5 on Windows. We're already at work to add support for <a href="/roadmap/">new versions, features and platforms</a>!</p>
