<p><a href="/news/2012/10/08/unityvs-1-0-10">UnityVS 1.0.10</a> was a great release for us. Today we're pleased to release its successor, <a href="/documentation/changelog/#1.0.11">UnityVS 1.0.11</a>, packing a nice list of changes.</p>

<h2>Unity 4</h2>

<p><br/>Since UnityVS 1.0.1, we had a preview support for Unity 4. Today we're happy to say that with UnityVS 1.0.11 we officialy support Unity 4. Congratulations to our friends at Unity Technologies for shipping, this is quite the milestone! Somes fixes to the debugger interface of Unity's scripting engine went into Unity 4, we strongly encourage UnityVS users to upgrade to Unity 4.</p>

<h2>Manipulate scripts from the Unity Project Explorer</h2>

<p><br/>Unity and Visual Studio have a different concept of what a project is. For Unity, a project is collection of scripts, and it deals internally with the order they're compiled. For Visual Studio, a project maps to one language. Which is why we created the Unity Project Explorer, which gives you the same view of your project you have in Unity, in Visual Studio. We improved the Unity Project Explorer to let you create, rename and delete scripts from Visual Studio. This fixes one major annoyance: the necessity to reload all the projects everytime you added or deleted a script from Unity.</p>

<h2>Navigate To</h2>

<p><br/>Visual Studio 2010 introduced a new window accessible from Edit -> Navigate To. You can use it to search for anything in your project, be it the name of a type, a field, a function, or even a file name, and to quickly navigate there. We now provide symbol information for UnityScript and Boo to this dialog. Of course, C# support comes out of the box with Visual Studio.</p>
