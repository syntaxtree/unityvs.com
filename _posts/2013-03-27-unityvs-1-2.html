<p>The UnityVS team is very proud to release a new and exciting version of UnityVS!</p>

<p>It's been over eight months since our initial release, and a lot has been done to improve and optimize our product. UnityVS 1.2 marks another milestone for us, with new exciting features, such as the ability to debug Unity players from Visual Studio, or optimizations such as a drastically reduced speed to attach the debugger. And of course, many bug fixes.</p>

<p>It's also the first time UnityVS is present at the GDC, as the UnityVS team is a proud sponsor of the Unity booth at the Game Developer Conference in San Francisco.</p>

If you purchased a UnityVS Personal license in the previous 30 days, you'll automatically qualify for a $25 discount on your next UnityVS one year update subscription.</p>

<h2>Unity Players Debugging</h2>

<p>Prior to this release, UnityVS could only attach the debugger to a Unity Editor. This is great when developing your game, as it fits easily in the workflow. However, you sometimes need to debug players if you observe a different behavior between game code running in the editor and inside a player. UnityVS makes it now <a href="/documentation/player-debugging">very easy to debug Unity players</a>, right into Visual Studio.</p>

<a name="Optimizations"></a>
<h2>Optimizations</h2>

<p>We worked hard to optimize UnityVS for this release.</p>

<p>One of the most praised UnityVS feature is the Unity Project Explorer. It's a Visual Studio tool window that gives you the same view of your project as the one you have in Unity. It's great because you don't have to dive into different generated projects before finding your scripts. In UnityVS 1.0, the Unity Project Explorer could take a long time to be displayed for projects with a large number of scripts, and that would impact the load time of a UnityVS solution. In UnityVS 1.2, it's almost instantaneous. This will come in handy for those of you which are building large games.</p>

<p>Another target of optimization was the debugger connection speed. When you attach the Unity debugger to a Unity Editor or a Unity Player, the debugger has to query different informations, and this has been greatly improved. On one of our test machine, a standard development laptop, fully attaching the debugger to AngryBots went from over five seconds to less than a second.</p>
