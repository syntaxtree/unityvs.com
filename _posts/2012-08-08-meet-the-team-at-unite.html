title: Meet the team at Unite
---
<p>
<a href="http://syntaxtree.com/" target="_blank">SyntaxTree</a> is sponsoring <a href="http://unity3d.com/unite" target="_blank">Unite 2012</a>, this year's edition of the annual <a href="http://unity3d.com" target="_blank">Unity</a> conference!
</p>

<p>
We'll have an exhibitor table, and we're sending both team members <a href="http://twitter.com/jbevain" target="_blank">Jb Evain</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/sailro">S&eacute;bastien Lebreton</a> for the duration of the event. This is the perfect opportunity to come and discuss UnityVS with us. You just have to look for our big and magnificent UnityVS poster to find our table.
</p>

<p>
This is going to be both a very special event for <a href="http://unityvs.com" target="_blank">UnityVS</a>, and a milestone. We hope to see you in Amsterdam!
