title: New productivity features

<p>
Not only we have been fixing bugs in the beta, but we're also implementing new productivity features based on beta testers feedbacks.  
</p>

<h3>Unity Project Explorer</h3>

<p>
Take for instance the &ldquo;Unity Project Explorer&rdquo; view, it's quite handy as it mirrors the view of your project that you have inside Unity. But now you can even dive into the different scripts and directly go to the script function you're interested in.

<h3>Script method wizard</h3>

<p>
When writing a Unity script, be it in C#, UnityScript or Boo, you need to implement special methods that are recognized by Unity. You can now invoke the method creation wizard with a few keystrokes, and select the methods to add to your script.

<h3>Quick script method creator</h3>

<p>
If you know exactly the script method you want to implement, press ctrl+shift+q to open the quick script method window. Quickly type the method name by using camel bumps (inspired by Resharper's Goto-Type or Goto-Member functionality) to create a script method stub.
