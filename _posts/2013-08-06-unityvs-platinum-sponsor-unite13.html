<p>UnityVS, your plugin to write and debug your Unity games inside Visual Studio finishes its Unite conference tour in a bang!</p>

<p>The UnityVS team is super proud to be a <a href="http://unity3d.com/unite/unite2013/sponsors" target="_blank">Platinum Sponsor</a> of <a href="http://unity3d.com/unite13" target="_blank">Unite 2013</a> in Vancouver, the biggest Unity conference of the year.</p>

<p>We'll have a splendid booth with UnityVS licenses to win every day, we'll be doing a sponsored session and we'll have some pretty nice things to announce! Keep an eye on the <a href="http://unity3d.com/unite/unite2013/schedule" target="_blank">Unite 2013 schedule</a>.</p>

<p>This event is especially important for the UnityVS team as it marks the one year anniversary of the initial release of UnityVS. The last year has been a fantastic journey: UnityVS is now used by thousands of teams all over the world, from indies working at night on their games, to AAA studios.</p>

<p>We're looking forward to seeing you at the UnityVS booth and celebrating with you!</p>
