<p>Two days ago, <a href="http://www.visualstudiolaunch.com/" target="_blank">Visual Studio 2012 was officially launched</a>.</p>

<p>Today, we release the support of Visual Studio 2012 with <a href="/documentation/changelog/#1.0.7">UnityVS 1.0.7</a>.</p>

<p>You can have both UnityVS 2010 and UnityVS 2012 installed. Just make sure you import the proper version of our Unity Package inside your Unity project, and you'll be good to go.</p>

<p>Unity Pro customers can now have a Visual Studio that matches beautifully with Unity.</p>
