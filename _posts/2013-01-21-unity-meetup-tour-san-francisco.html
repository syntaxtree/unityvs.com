<p>After <a href="/news/2013/01/16/unity-meetup-tour-seattle">Seattle</a>, our next stop on our Unity Meetup Tour is in <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Bay-Area-Unity-Users/">San Francisco</a></p>

<p>On the evening of January the 30th, we'll be making a <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Bay-Area-Unity-Users/events/99561162/">UnityVS presentation at the Bay Areay Unity User Group</a>. As it is now traditional, attendees will have the chance to win a couple UnityVS Personal license, so make sure to join!</p>

<p>What we wrote for the previous meetup is still very much true:</p>

<blockquote>Not only will we be talking about UnityVS, but we'll also talk about what was is it like to write a tool targeting Unity, and the Unity ecosystem itself. And after the talk of course, there will be plenty of room for discussions. We're hoping to meet you there!</blockquote>
