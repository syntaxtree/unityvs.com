<p>Today the UnityVS team is proud to release <a href="/documentation/changelog/#1.8.0">UnityVS 1.8</a>, a new major release.</p>

<p>It's the first version we ship since the first year anniversary of UnityVS, and it's hard to think that we shipped UnityVS 1.0 only a year ago. What a ride it has been: we've shipped dozens of intermediate versions, we sponsored every major Unity event in the entire world, there's now thousands of teams using UnityVS to write their games using the best C# IDE in the world: Visual Studio, and we're immensely proud to be part of our customers success.</p>

<p>For UnityVS 1.8, we made a point in this release to speed-up and improve your daily workflow.</p>

<h3>Debugging speed</h3>

<p>We radically improved the speed to attach the debugger, UnityVS 1.8 now takes a fraction of the time UnityVS 1.2 used to take to fully attach the debugger. It's immediately noticeable, and it allows very short iterations.</p>

<h3>Opening files to the proper line</h3>

<p>It seems like a simple operation, but until Unity 4.2, we didn't have a way to open a file from Unity at the proper line. UnityVS 1.8 now automatically uses the new Unity API to achieve this.</p>

<h3>And much more</h3>

<p>Besides, UnityVS 1.8 is also packed with bug fixes and new features. Please refer to the <a href="/documentation/changelog/#1.8.0">UnityVS 1.8 change log</a>.</p>

<h3>The road to 2.0</h3>

<p>We're already working hard on the next version of UnityVS where we will address two commonly asked features: remote debugging of Unity editors running on OS X, and Unity's shader language support in Visual Studio.</p>

<h3>Thanks</h3>

<p>Once more we take this opportunity to thank all our customer for their continued support, for their bug reports, and for spreading the word about UnityVS. The UnityVS team is proud of the positive reputation we gained over the last year, please never hesitate <a href="/support">to contact us</a> should you have any issue with UnityVS. Here's to another fantastic year for UnityVS!</p>
