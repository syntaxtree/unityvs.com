<p>As Unite reminded us last August, being part of the Unity ecosystem and community really is important to us. We just love talking to Unity users and see all the amazing stuff they create. It also makes it a lot easier to get feedback and ideas for UnityVS.</p>

<p>We decided to tour the different Unity user groups and meetups to show and discuss UnityVS with the Unity community.</p>

<p>London is our first stop on November 29, thanks to the always amazing <a href="http://www.meetup.com/London-Unity-Usergroup/">London Unity User Group</a>! You can RSVP on the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/London-Unity-Usergroup/events/92004002/">meetup page</a>.</p>
