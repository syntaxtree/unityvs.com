<p>The last year was a particularly exciting time for the UnityVS team. During the course of 2012, we opened UnityVS' beta, finished major features, and at Unite in Amsterdam, we shipped UnityVS 1.0.</p>

<p>The end of the year has been even more exciting, with a lot of work put towards supporting our customers and improving UnityVS. We're very excited to see UnityVS used all over the globe by hundreds of teams of various sizes, from indie studios to large gaming companies.</p>

<p>We also started a tour of the different Unity User Groups all over the world. It's very important for us to go and meet the community at large. In 2013 we'll continue this tour, more on that in the coming days.

<p>And most of all, we'll continue to improve UnityVS, fix bugs, and add new features. As a matter of fact, we're starting this year by shipping a bug fix release, <a href="/documentation/changelog/#1.0.12">UnityVS 1.0.12</a>.</p>

<p>The entire UnityVS team at <a href="http://syntaxtree.com/" target="_blank">SyntaxTree</a> wishes you all a fantastic year 2013.</p>
