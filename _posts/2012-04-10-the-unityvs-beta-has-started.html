title: The UnityVS beta has started!
---
<p>
Good news everyone, we're starting the beta phase today!
</p>

<p>
It's a really exciting time, we're absolutely thrilled by the amount of positive feedback we received after UnityVS has been announced. Thanks for all the support and encouragement you sent our way, both to our <a href="http://twitter.com/UnityVS">twitter</a> account and on <a href="http://facebook.com/UnityVS">facebook</a>.
</p>

<p>
If you didn't receive a mail with a beta license, do not worry! During the next days and weeks, we'll gradually open the beta to more and more testers, based on the order they signed up for the beta. Beta testers will simply receive a mail at the address they used to sign up, with the instructions on how to get UnityVS and how to participate.
