UnityVS Software License Agreement

PLEASE READ THIS AGREEMENT CAREFULLY. BY INSTALLING, DOWNLOADING OR OTHERWISE USING THE SOFTWARE, YOU AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THESE TERMS, DO NOT DOWNLOAD, INSTALL OR USE THE SOFTWARE.
RIGHTS AND LICENSES

This SyntaxTree Software License Agreement (“Agreement”) is a legal agreement between You (an entity or a person) and SyntaxTree SARL (“SyntaxTree”). The software product identified in the title of this Agreement for which You have acquired licenses, any media and accompanying documentation (collectively the “Software”) is protected by the copyright laws and treaties of the United States (“U.S.”) and other countries and is subject to the terms of this Agreement. Any update or support release to the Software that You may download or receive that is not accompanied by a license agreement expressly superseding this Agreement is Software and governed by this Agreement. If the Software is an update or support release, then You must have validly licensed the version and quantity of the Software being updated or supported in order to install or use the update or support release.
The Software is comprised of numerous components that may be accompanied by separate license terms. The Software is a collective work of SyntaxTree; although SyntaxTree does not own the copyright to every component of the Software, SyntaxTree owns the collective work copyright for the Software.

Some of the components are open source packages, developed independently, and accompanied by separate license terms. Your license rights with respect to individual components accompanied by separate license terms are defined by those terms; nothing in this agreement shall restrict, limit, or otherwise affect any rights or obligations You may have, or conditions to which You may be subject, under such license terms; however, if You distribute copies of any component independent of the Software, You must remove all SyntaxTree trademarks, trade dress, and logos from each copy.

"Instance" means the initial copy of the Software necessary for execution of the Software and each additional copy (or partial copy) of the Software stored or loaded in memory or virtual memory.
You must acquire an Enterprise Instance, Professional Instance, Personal Instance or Student Instance license for each Instance of the Software.

OTHER LICENSE TERMS AND RESTRICTIONS
The Software is protected by the copyright laws and treaties of France and other countries and is subject to the terms of this Agreement. The Software is licensed to You, not sold.
The Software may be bundled with other software programs ("Bundled Programs"). Your license rights with respect to Bundled Programs accompanied by separate license terms are defined by those terms; nothing in this Agreement shall restrict, limit, or otherwise affect any rights or obligations You may have, or conditions to which You may be subject, under such license terms.

SyntaxTree reserves all rights not expressly granted to You. You may not: (1) reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the Software except and only to the extent it is expressly permitted by applicable law; or (2) transfer the Software or Your license rights under this Agreement, in whole or in part.
Evaluation Software. If the Software is an evaluation version or is provided to You for evaluation purposes, then Your license to use the Software is limited solely to internal evaluation purposes and in accordance with the terms of the evaluation offering under which You received the Software and expires 14 days from installation (or such other period as may be indicated within the Software). Upon expiration of the evaluation period, You must discontinue use of the Software, return to an original state any actions performed by the Software, and delete the Software entirely from Your system. The Software may contain an automatic disabling mechanism that prevents its use after a certain period of time, so You should back up Your system and take other measures to prevent any loss of files or data.

MAINTENANCE AND SUPPORT
SyntaxTree has no obligation to provide support or maintenance unless You purchase an offering that expressly includes support or maintenance services. If You make such a purchase and no separate agreement specifically applies to the support or maintenance services, then the terms of this Agreement will govern the provision of such support or maintenance services (“Services“). For more information on SyntaxTree's current support offerings, see http://unityvs.com/pricing.

OWNERSHIP
No title to or ownership of the Software is transferred to You. SyntaxTree and/or its licensors retain all right, title and interest in and to all intellectual property rights in the Software and Services, including any adaptations or copies thereof. You acquire only a conditional license to use the Software.

LIMITED WARRANTY
For thirty (30) days from Your date of purchase, SyntaxTree warrants that (1) any media on which the Software is delivered is free from physical defects; and (2) the Software will substantially conform to the documentation accompanying the Software. If the defective items are returned to SyntaxTree or if You report the nonconformity to SyntaxTree within thirty (30) days from the date of purchase, SyntaxTree will at its sole discretion either resolve the nonconformity or refund the license fees You paid for the Software. Any unauthorized use or modification to the Software voids this warranty. THE FOREGOING WARRANTY IS YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY AND IS IN LIEU OF ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. (The foregoing warranty does not apply to Software provided free of charge. SUCH SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS” WITHOUT ANY WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND.)
Services.

SyntaxTree warrants that any Services purchased will be supplied in a professional manner in accordance with generally accepted industry standards. This warranty will be effective for thirty (30) days following delivery of the Services. Upon any breach of this warranty, SyntaxTree’s only obligation is to either correct the Services so that they comply with this warranty or at its option refund the amount You paid to SyntaxTree for the portion of the Services that fail to comply with this warranty. As files may be altered or damaged in the course of SyntaxTree providing technical services, You agree to take appropriate measures to isolate and back up Your systems.
THE SOFTWARE IS NOT DESIGNED, MANUFACTURED OR INTENDED FOR USE OR DISTRIBUTION WITH ON-LINE CONTROL EQUIPMENT IN HAZARDOUS ENVIRONMENTS REQUIRING FAIL-SAFE PERFORMANCE, SUCH AS IN THE OPERATION OF NUCLEAR FACILITIES, AIRCRAFT NAVIGATION, COMMUNICATION, OR CONTROL SYSTEMS, DIRECT LIFE SUPPORT MACHINES, WEAPONS SYSTEMS, OR OTHER USES IN WHICH FAILURE OF THE SOFTWARE COULD LEAD DIRECTLY TO DEATH, PERSONAL INJURY, OR SEVERE PHYSICAL OR ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE.
THE SOFTWARE IS ONLY COMPATIBLE WITH CERTAIN COMPUTERS AND OPERATING SYSTEMS. THE SOFTWARE IS NOT WARRANTED FOR NON-COMPATIBLE SYSTEMS. Call SyntaxTree or Your reseller for information about compatibility.
Non-SyntaxTree Products. The Software may include or be bundled with hardware or other software programs or services licensed or sold by an entity other than SyntaxTree. SyntaxTree DOES NOT WARRANT NON-SyntaxTree PRODUCTS OR SERVICES. ANY SUCH PRODUCTS OR SERVICES ARE PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” BASIS. WARRANTY SERVICE IF ANY FOR NON-SyntaxTree PRODUCTS IS PROVIDED BY THE PRODUCT LICENSOR IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE APPLICABLE LICENSOR WARRANTY.
EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE RESTRICTED BY LAW, SyntaxTree DISCLAIMS AND EXCLUDES ANY AND ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES INCLUDING ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT. SyntaxTree MAKES NO WARRANTY, REPRESENTATION OR PROMISE NOT EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS LIMITED WARRANTY. SyntaxTree DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE SOFTWARE OR SERVICES WILL SATISFY YOUR REQUIREMENTS OR THAT THE OPERATION OF THE SOFTWARE OR SERVICES WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED. Some jurisdictions do not allow certain disclaimers and limitations of warranties, so portions of the above limitations may not apply to You. This limited warranty gives You specific rights and You may also have other rights which vary by state or jurisdiction.

LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
REGARDLESS OF WHETHER ANY REMEDY SET FORTH HEREIN FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR OR ITS SUPPLIERS OR RESELLERS BE LIABLE TO LICENSEE UNDER ANY THEORY FOR ANY DAMAGES SUFFERED BY LICENSEE OR ANY USER OF THE SOFTWARE, OR FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR SIMILAR DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF BUSINESS PROFITS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF BUSINESS INFORMATION, OR ANY OTHER PECUNIARY LOSS) ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE SOFTWARE, OR THE PROVISION OF OR FAILURE TO PROVIDE SUPPORT SERVICES, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, AND REGARDLESS OF THE LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY (CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) UPON WHICH THE CLAIM IS BASED. 

IN ANY CASE, LICENSOR'S ENTIRE LIABILITY UNDER ANY PROVISION OF THIS AGREEMENT WILL BE LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT ACTUALLY PAID BY LICENSEE FOR THE SOFTWARE. BECAUSE SOME STATES AND JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY, THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO LICENSEE. 

GENERAL TERMS
Term. This Agreement becomes effective on the date You legally acquire the Software and will automatically terminate if You breach any of its terms.
Benchmark Testing. This benchmark testing restriction applies to You if You are a software developer or licensor or if You are performing testing on the Software at the direction of or on behalf of a software developer or licensor. You may not, without SyntaxTree's prior written consent not to be unreasonably withheld, publish or disclose to any third party the results of any benchmark test of the Software. If You are a licensor of products that are functionally similar to or compete with the Software (“Similar Products”), or are acting on behalf of such a licensor, and You publish or disclose benchmark information on the Software in violation of this restriction, then notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Similar Product's end user license agreement, and in addition to any other remedies SyntaxTree may have, SyntaxTree shall have the right to perform benchmark testing on Similar Products and to disclose and publish that benchmark information and You hereby represent that You have authority to grant such right to SyntaxTree.
Open Source. Nothing in this Agreement shall restrict, limit or otherwise affect any rights or obligations You may have, or conditions to which You may be subject, under any applicable open source licenses to any open source code contained in the Software. Transfer. This Agreement may not be transferred or assigned without the prior written approval of SyntaxTree.
Law and Jurisdiction. This Agreement is governed by the laws of France. Any action at law relating to this Agreement may only be brought before the courts of competent jurisdiction of France. This Agreement sets forth the entire understanding and agreement between You and SyntaxTree and may be amended or modified only by a written agreement agreed to by You and an authorized representative of SyntaxTree. NO LICENSOR, DISTRIBUTOR, DEALER, RETAILER, RESELLER, SALES PERSON, OR EMPLOYEE IS AUTHORIZED TO MODIFY THIS AGREEMENT OR TO MAKE ANY REPRESENTATION OR PROMISE THAT IS DIFFERENT FROM, OR IN ADDITION TO, THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT.
Waiver. No waiver of any right under this Agreement will be effective unless in writing, signed by a duly authorized representative of the party to be bound. No waiver of any past or present right arising from any breach or failure to perform will be deemed to be a waiver of any future right arising under this Agreement.
Severability. If any provision in this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be construed, limited, modified or, if necessary, severed, to the extent necessary, to eliminate its invalidity or unenforceability, and the other provisions of this Agreement will remain unaffected.
