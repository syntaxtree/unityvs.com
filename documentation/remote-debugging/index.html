      <p>Remote debugging in UnityVS 1.0 is considered a preview feature, as it's known to not always work properly.</p>

      <h3>Configure the folder sharing of your VM</h3>
      <p>You simply need to share your Unity project folder.</p>

      <h3>Import the UnityVS package</h3>
      <p>You'll find it in your Program Files\UnityVS, or Program Files (x86)\UnityVS on 64 bits machines, you need to copy it to OS X, and import it in Unity there.</p>

      <h3>Open your project</h3>
      <p>In your VM, open the Visual Studio solution generated by UnityVS. Its name starts with UnityVS.YourProjectName. UnityVS won't be connected to your remote Unity. Click on the Unity icon in the status bar to open the selector, and chose your project.</p>
