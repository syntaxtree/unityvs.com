      <p>Remote debugging in UnityVS 1.0 is considered a preview feature. It's known to not always work properly, and to be difficult to configure.</p>

      <h3>Configure the folder sharing of your VM</h3>
      <p>You need to create at least two shared folders. One pointing to where Unity.app is installed, in most systems you'll be sharing /Applications/Unity/. The other one will be the folder of your Unity projects.</p>

      <h3>Import the UnityVS package</h3>
      <p>You'll find it in your Program Files\UnityVS, or Program Files (x86)\UnityVS on 64 bits machines, you need to copy it to OS X, and import it in Unity there.</p>

      <h3>Configure UnityVS</h3>
      <p>Open UnityVS' configuration window in Unity. Input the shared folder pointing to Unity.app. Then generate the solution files.</p>

      <h3>Open your project</h3>
      <p>In your VM, open the Visual Studio solution generated by UnityVS. Its name starts with UnityVS.YourProjectName. UnityVS won't be connected to your remote Unity. Click on the Unity icon in the status bar to open the selector, and chose your project.</p>
