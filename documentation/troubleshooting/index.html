      <h3>UnityVS solution won't load in Visual Studio</h3>
      <p>If Visual Studio complains that the generated csproj, unityproj and booproj are not supported, it's usually because the license is not properly installed. Use the <a href="/documentation/managing-licenses">license manager</a> to make sure your UnityVS license is properly registred.</p>

      <h3>On Windows 8, opening the UnityVS solution in Visual Studio results in an error window asking to download the Unity target framework</h3>
      <p>UnityVS requires that you install the .net framework 3.5 on Windows 8.</p>

      <h3>Clicking on console entries in Unity won't navigate to the precise line in Visual Studio</h3>
      <p>That's a known issue, the reason is that Unity only provides us with the file name of the console entry. There's a couple of workarounds described in the <a href="/documentation/issues">known issue page</a>.</p>
